## Bejeweled game 
Here are the instructions to set up everything to run this app on your local machine. 
I have used Facebook's Create React App, an environment that comes pre-configured with all the requirements needed. 
Make sure you have 5.2 or higher in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Please clone the bejeweled-game repository into your machine. 
Once the cloning is complete, move into the bejeweled directory:
### `cd bejeweled-game`

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
followed by:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

### Deployment

This section has moved here: https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment

### `npm run build` fails to minify

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
